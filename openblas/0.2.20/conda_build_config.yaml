# "$OPENBLAS_CORETYPE" is needed to get "DYNAMIC_ARCH=1" builds working
# correctly on VMs with unreliable CPU identification; specifically, our OS X
# 10.9 build VMs seem to always identify their CPU microarchitecture as
# "Penryn", even when the VM host has a CPU with a more recent (Nehalem or
# later) microarchitecture. However, since we can pass-through and use newer
# (e.g., SSE4.2 or AVX) instructions, setting this environment variable lets us
# properly build our modified "dynamic arch" library. Without it, "make tests"
# will likely fail with an "Architecture Initialization failed" error when
# building inside such VMs.
