  summary: Generalized and Classical Blockmodeling of Valued Networks
  description: |
    This is primarily meant as an implementation of Generalized blockmodeling
    for valued networks. In addition, measures of similarity or dissimilarity
    based on structural equivalence and regular equivalence (REGE algorithm)
    can be computed and partitioned matrices can be plotted. This is a CRAN
    version. A newer version is available on R-forge, which for however lacks
    help files.
